The Internet of Things (IoT) has a significant effect on the evolution of modern Information and Communication Technology. It reshapes the traditional network infrastructures with novel hardware and software technologies. In this work we analyse the IoT platforms from the communication architecture point of view and we evaluate the effects of the communication anomalies on different edges of the data lines to the end-to-end transmission performance. To improve the communication performance and resilience of these systems we adopt hybrid network infrastructures composed of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and redundant non-SDN segments, and we define a method that automatically performs dynamic switching between the redundant non-SDN communication edges. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method through laboratory-scale experiments using a real networking infrastructure.
