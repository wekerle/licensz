Abstract: This paper focuses on the integration of advances sensing and control technologies into advanced systems of multiple Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). In particular, we focus on the key technologies developed within Plug-and-Navigate Robots (PAN-Robots) project, highlighting how those results contribute in improving the performance of AGV systems.
