Abstract: The description of natural phenomena from different Earth Observation (EO) activity domains is represented by complex processes that involve a solid understanding of the phenomena, the syntactic and semantic description of the proposed solutions, the experimental data collection, and the analysis and interpretation of the results. Such a use case scenario is modeled as a collection of operators that are able to generate in a finite amount of time a valid output, based on a range of inputs data sets. The current paper aims at identifying the main EO data processing types and providing a set of basic operators that represent the core of the KEOPS (Kernel Operators) system. At the moment, several researches are conducted to find the best solution of integrating this system within the BigEarth platform, but the main idea is to use KEOPS as a plugin that can fit within any EO related platform that aims at processing spatial data. One main advantage of using the KEOPS system is the possibility of easily extending its core dataset with new operators that fulfill the needs of developing complex use case scenarios.
