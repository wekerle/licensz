Semantic Investigation of a Control-Flow Subset of BPMN 2.0

Eneia Nicolae Todoran, Paulina Mitrea

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), now at version 2.0.2, provides a standard graphical 
representation for specifying business processes. In this paper we report on the first stage of a semantic 
investigation of BPMN, using methods in the tradition of programming languages semantics. We consider a 
control-flow subset of BPMN and an execution architecture based on an intermediate language that we name 
$\cal{L}$$_{BPMN}$. 
The execution architecture comprises two main components: a translator which 
takes as input a BPMN model and generates $\cal{L}$$_{BPMN}$ code, and an interpreter 
for $\cal{L}$$_{BPMN}$. $\cal{L}$$_{BPMN}$ is a process oriented imperative language providing a combination of 
concepts, including maximal parallelism and durational activities. 
We employ the mathematical methodology of metric semantics in designing 
and relating an operational semantics $\cal{O}$ and a denotational semantics $\cal{D}$ for $\cal{L}$$_{BPMN}$. 
We establish the formal relation between $\cal{O}$ and $\cal{D}$ by using an 
abstraction operator and a fixed point argument. In this way we prove the 
correctness of the denotational semantics with respect to the operational 
semantics. We focus on the semantic investigation of BPMN. We also explain 
how the operational semantics can serve as a blueprint for an implementation 
on a client-server architecture.
