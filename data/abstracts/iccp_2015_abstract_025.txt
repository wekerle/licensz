The inspection, assessment, maintenance and safe operation of the existing civil infrastructure consists one of the major challenges facing engineers today. Such work requires either manual approaches, which are slow and yield subjective results, or automated approaches, which depend upon complex handcrafted features. Yet, for the latter case, it is rarely known in advance which features are important for the problem at hand. In this paper, we propose a fully automated tunnel assessment approach; using the raw input from a single monocular camera we hierarchically construct complex features, exploiting the advantages of deep learning architectures. Obtained features are used to train an appropriate defect detector. In particular, we exploit a Convolutional Neural Network to construct high-level features and as a detector we choose to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron due to its global function approximation properties. Such an approach achieves very fast predictions due to the feed-forward nature of Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Layer Perceptrons.
