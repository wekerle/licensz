Abstract: With the growth of Cloud Computing as support for Big Data Platforms, new challenges have appeared in the development of data centers. Up until now, datacenters where mainly using resources such as CPUs, Hard-disks, RAM and where limited by the I/O guaranteed by different network topologies used to interconnect the servers. Now, with the capabilities offered by GPGPUs, ASICs, FPGAs for accelerating applications such as automatic learning, weather prediction, molecular modeling and many others, the heterogeneity of resources must also be taken into account. Also, considering the fact that servers consume up to 60\% peak energy while idle and the fact that usually server utilization ranges in 20-30\%, new load balancing strategies must be developed in order to deal with all this issues. In this paper we present the various properties of a novel, biologically inspired, spider mesh overlay used for load balancing non-preemptive tasks, each task consuming a certain amount of resources. The spider mesh overlay is structured in chains and rings. The nodes on each chain of the overlay are capable of offering the best capacity for a certain resource (e.g. powerful CPU for CPU-bound tasks) while offering smaller capacities for the other resources. If all the nodes on a chain are unable to "fit-in" a task, various routing policies are used in order to assign a job to a fitting node, or, in the worst case, provision/switch-on another node. The jobs are distributed by a central broker by using two methods, classic round-robin and a clustering approach based on workload characterization in order to choose the chain most capable of processing the job. By analyzing several properties of the overlay such as average resource utilization per node, maximum number of used nodes and message routing patterns we conclude the viability of the proposed solution.
