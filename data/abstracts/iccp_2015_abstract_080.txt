Information retrieval in falktales using natural language processing

Adrian Groza, Lidia Corde

Abstract: Our aim is to extract information about literary characters in unstructured texts. We employ natural language processing and reasoning on domain ontologies. The first task is to identify the main characters and the parts of the story where these characters are described or act. We illustrate the system in a scenario in the folktale domain. The system relies on a folktale ontology that we have developed based Propp's model for folktales morphology.
