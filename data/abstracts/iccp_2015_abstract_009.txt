This paper presents a system capable of identifying and validating various human body gestures. Body data is acquired from a Kinect sensor and consist in a set of bones represented by their rotation in 3D space. The main goal is to correctly identify the user performed gesture and return feedback related to its performance accuracy. A database with several samples for each gesture is built and used as ground truth in the gesture validation process. A novel dynamic time warping algorithm is proposed for synchronizing the performed gesture with the corresponding ground truth dataset. If the sequences are not synchronized, feedback is returned to user as a comparison between its performance and the closest sample in the database. Experimental results show high accuracy at about 90\% success rate. The system performs better for gestures in which the usersâ€™ body is fully exposed to the sensor.
