Abstract: In this paper we propose an extensible framework over Jena and OWL API that maps complex Java data models onto semantic models based on some custom annotations in order to benefit from the advantages of ontologies in software engineering. Furthermore, it facilitates the implementation of basic CRUD operations for the domain classes and objects, also allowing the definition of new custom operations. We have performed tests on the Stanford Wine ontology, obtaining a code complexity reduction of up to 85\% compared to the classical approaches using Jena or OWL API without noticeable performance reduction.
