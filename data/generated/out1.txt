Distributed Computing
With the introduction of the smart grid, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has become a main component in the present power system. The effective implementation of AMI depends widely on its communication infrastructure and protocols providing trustworthy two-way communications. In this paper we study two routing protocols philosophies for low power and lossy networks (LLNs) and their application for a smart metering scenario. This study purposes a detailed evaluation of two routing protocols proposed by IETF the proactive candidate namely RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) and the reactive candidate named LOADng (LLN On-demand Ad-hoc Distance vector routing protocol â€“ next generation) recently proposed as an internet Draft , still in its design phase and is part of the ITU-T G.9903 recommendation. In the course of this study, we also implemented an extension version of LOADng named LOADng-CTP specified by an IETF draft extended with a collection tree for efficient data acquisition in LLNs. We performed checks on control overhead; End to End Delay and Packet delivery ratio for the two protocols related to multipoint-to-point (MP2P), and point-to-multi point (P2MP) traffic flow in a realistic smart metering architecture.
