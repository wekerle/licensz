Intelligent Systems
In this paper, we address the problem of word auto-completion for free text (e.g. messages, emails, articles, poems, etc.) written in different languages. We focus on improving user experience by developing a user-oriented model that is able to learn different writing styles, while still providing initial predictions without any user written documents. We show that by learning from the user, the performance of an auto-completion system can be improved by up to 18 \%. In order to keep query processing times low, we deploy a binary search technique that retrieves groups of words from an inverted index based on their prefix. This retrieval method reduces the query processing time by up to 70\%.
