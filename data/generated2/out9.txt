Computer Vision
The objective of this research is to provide a deployable driving simulation framework with the focus on increasing modeling realism. A traffic and driving simulator concept was developed using Open Street Map (OSM) for the three-dimensional (3D) generation of the corresponding visualization module. The proposed framework includes Glosm, a hardware-accelerated OpenGL based on OSM. Glosm provides stable 3D generation of a virtual vehicular urban system using OSM data and a real-time first-person viewer. First, a 3D car model was implemented in Glosm. Then, a driving and traffic simulator (without graphics) was developed including all the required functions for representation and motion handling within Glosm. Initially, a way of testing was defined and implemented for all future development of the navigation handler. The goal was to determine the configuration of the OSM-type road network from a given position in order to compute the navigation trajectories. The data system of OSM was highly unsuitable for this application because the roads are included in the same layer as other objects. Unity is an alternative to Glosm. Some information about Unity is provided with recommendations for future research.
